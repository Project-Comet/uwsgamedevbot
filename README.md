# Bjarne 

Bjarne is a Discord server bot built for and maintained by the UWS Game Dev Society.

This branch is written in JavaScript using [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js), a wrapper for the Discord API.

It is currently hosted on the Heroku cloud platform.

## Contributing
If you are a member of the society and wish to add features, enhancements or fix bugs your contribution is welcome!

Feel free to choose an item in the Planned list of the [Features](#features) section.

To get started you should get the example running from the [discord.js repo](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) and check out the documentation there. For a more in-depth tutorial there is a really handy [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9) with guides for basic operations.

For developing the bot you should create your own bot and run it on your own private server to test out your functions so we can avoid a lot of bother with security tokens and the Bjarne bot being hosted in a cloud server. Once you are happy you can submit a pull request and it can be added to Bjarne.

If you have any questions for making a contribution, or a code related question for your change you can message @midnightpacific or @@Medallyon#5012 on the Discord server.

### Requirements
You will need Node.js v8+ and the [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) library, instructions for installing discord.js 
are available on its repo page.
